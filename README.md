# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-ResNet
Developed a machine learning model with an F1 score of 0.95 to detect skin cancer using computer vision (ResNet-18) and image processing techniques.  

The project aimed to improve early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer through automated analysis of dermatological images.
